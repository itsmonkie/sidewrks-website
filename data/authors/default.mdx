Matt builds small, real products alongside his day job. Sidewrks is his workspace for shipping side projects, logging decisions, and learning from outcomes in public.

His focus is on simple tools, fast feedback, and avoiding performative “building in public”. Projects are scoped tightly, time-boxed, and either shipped, paused, or killed based on signal.

Sidewrks exists to make progress visible and to create momentum through doing rather than planning.
