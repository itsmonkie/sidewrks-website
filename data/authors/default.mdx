I'm Matt, and I build small, real products alongside my day job. Sidewrks is my workspace for shipping side projects, logging decisions, and learning from outcomes in public.

My focus is on simple tools, fast feedback, and avoiding performative "building in public". I scope projects tightly, time-box them, and either ship, pause, or kill them based on signal.

Sidewrks exists to make progress visible and to create momentum through doing rather than planning.
