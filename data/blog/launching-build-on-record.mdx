# Launching Build on Record

I've just pushed the first version of **Build on Record** live.

You can find it at [buildonrecord.com](https://buildonrecord.com).

This is a short note on why it exists, why I bothered building it, and how it fits into a broader idea I keep coming back to: building in public without turning it into a performance.

## The thing I kept noticing

I build things a lot. Products, teams, systems, side projects.

And like anyone who builds, I make a constant stream of decisions. Some small, some structural, some that feel obvious at the time and questionable later.

Over the years, a pattern became hard to ignore:

- Decisions get made quickly
- The reasoning fades fast
- Outcomes are remembered selectively
- Lessons get reconstructed after the fact

When things go well, the story tightens. When they go badly, the context quietly disappears.

That's not bad faith. It's just how humans work.

But it makes learning harder than it needs to be.

## Why building in public helps, when it's done quietly

I've always liked the idea of building in public, but not in the loud, polished, thread-heavy way it's often framed.

The version that resonates with me is much quieter:

- Showing real work, not just finished artefacts
- Making thinking visible, not just outcomes
- Being honest about uncertainty
- Leaving a trail you can come back to later

Done well, building in public creates accountability. Mostly to yourself.

When you write something down at the moment you decide, you're forced to be explicit. When you know you might re-read it later, or let others see it, you tend to be a bit more careful with your reasoning.

Not perfect. Just more deliberate.

## What Build on Record actually is

Build on Record is a simple decision log.

It lets you capture decisions as they happen, including:

- The context
- The decision itself
- The reasoning behind it
- Your confidence at the time
- What you expect to happen
- A future review point

Later, you can come back and record what actually happened.

That's it.

It's private by default. You can choose to make individual records public if you want to.

There's a web app for creating projects and logging records, and a CLI so you can do it where you already work. No heavy process. No forced ceremony.

You can log a decision in a couple of minutes.

## What it very deliberately isn't

This matters.

Build on Record is not:

- A journalling app
- A productivity system
- A goal tracker
- A social network
- A performance tool for other people

It's intentionally narrow.

It exists to help you externalise your thinking at the point decisions are made, and to give you something concrete to reflect on later.

If it tries to do more than that, it will fail.

## Why I built it

Part of this is selfish.

I wanted something like this for my own projects, especially side projects where there's no built-in structure or external accountability.

When you're building on your own:

- No one asks why you chose option A over option B
- No one remembers what you thought six months ago
- It's very easy to rewrite history in your head

A decision log cuts through that.

The other part is more outward-facing.

By putting my own decisions on record, I'm trying to model a version of building in public that feels realistic and achievable. Not polished. Not overly confident. Just honest.

If that nudges others to do the same, even privately at first, that feels worthwhile.

## Why now

This is very much a v1.

It's intentionally simple. It does the minimum useful thing and no more.

I've learned the hard way that waiting for something to feel finished usually means it never ships. Or it ships too late to learn anything useful from real usage.

So this is me choosing momentum over polish.

I'll use it myself. I'll see where it breaks. I'll adjust based on that.

If other people find it useful, great. If not, I'll still have built something that sharpens how I think.

## How it fits with Sidewrks

Sidewrks exists as a place for me to talk about the things I'm building, the decisions behind them, and the lessons that fall out over time.

Build on Record is a natural extension of that.

It's not content. It's infrastructure for honesty.

Instead of writing retrospectively about why something worked or didn't, I can point back to the decision as it was made.

That feels healthier. And more interesting.

## What happens next

I'm not rushing to monetise this or scale it aggressively.

The next steps are deliberately simple:

- Use it consistently
- Improve the rough edges
- See how it fits into real workflows
- Learn from actual usage rather than imagined users

If you're building something, especially on the side, and you care about learning from your own decisions, you might find it useful too.

You can check it out at [buildonrecord.com](https://buildonrecord.com).

If nothing else, it might make you pause before your next decision and ask: *why am I choosing this?*

Sometimes that's enough.
