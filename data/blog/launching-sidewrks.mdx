# Launching Sidewrks

Sidewrks is live. This is a quiet workspace for shipping side projects in public.

## What it is

Sidewrks exists to make decisions, progress, and outcomes visible over time. It's not a community, a personal brand site, or a content platform. It's a workspace.

The goal is simple: ship small, real artefacts. Make decisions explicit. Create exposure to real signal. Build momentum through doing.

## What it isn't

This will not:

- Optimise for audience growth
- Host discussions or comments
- Act as a social network
- Encourage speculation over execution
- Accumulate half-finished ideas

If something does not directly support shipping or learning, it's out of scope.

## How it works

Projects live here with clear status: `idea | building | live | paused | killed`. Each project has:

- What it is
- Why it exists
- Current scope
- Status
- Links to artefacts or logs

Status changes are reflected explicitly. Killing a project is a valid outcome.

## The approach

Most "building in public" content is performative. Posts about what someone *might* do, or *plans* to do, or *wishes* they could do. That's not what this is.

Signal comes from reality, not engagement metrics. No comments. No likes. No follower mechanics. No gamification.

Content comes first, design second. Minimal colour, near-monochrome. Typography over components. If design draws attention to itself, it has failed.

## What to expect

At least one visible update per week:

- A shipped artefact
- A decision
- A status change

Silence is acceptable only if nothing meaningful happened.

## Starting point

This site itself is the first project. It's live. Future projects will be added as they're built, paused, or killed.

The spec is public. Decisions will be made explicit. Progress will be visible. Outcomes will be documented.

Let's ship.
