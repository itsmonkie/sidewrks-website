I could just keep building.

Most of my day job is not code anymore. As a CTO in fintech, my time is spent on strategy, hiring, alignment, risk, trade-offs. It is important work. I care about it. But it is not the same as sitting down and shaping something line by line.

Projects like rcordr are different.

An idea turns into code. Code turns into something usable. I try it in my own day. I notice friction. I refine it. I ship again.

That loop is not just productive. It is restorative.

After a day of meetings and decisions, writing code is a way of returning to something concrete. There is clarity in it. Effort in, result out. No politics. No negotiation. Just craft.

Left to my own devices, I would happily continue like this. Add a feature. Simplify a flow. Tighten the model. Release another version.

It gives me energy.

## The comfortable limitation

At the moment, I am the only real user of rcordr.

Every improvement reflects how I think. Every workflow fits my habits. Every design decision makes sense because I designed it.

That is efficient. It is also narrow.

If this is ever going to matter beyond me, it needs contact with people who do not share my context. It needs someone to misunderstand it. To struggle with it. To use it in a way I did not expect.

Without that, I can keep refining it indefinitely and still never discover whether it resonates.

The risk is not that it fails. The risk is that it remains perfectly suited to one person.

## Joy and exposure pull in different directions

Here is the real tension.

Building privately is joyful. It reconnects me to the part of the job I miss. It reminds me why I got into this industry in the first place.

Opening something up changes the dynamic.

It introduces explanation. Feedback. Expectations. A subtle shift from "this is for me" to "this is for others".

There is nothing wrong with that shift. In fact, it is necessary if you want something to grow.

But I am conscious that I use rcordr as a way of unwinding. It is a space without pressure. If I am not careful, inviting the outside world in turns my place of restoration into another performance surface.

That is not what I want.

At the same time, staying private forever is its own form of avoidance. It keeps the work comfortable, but it also keeps it untested.

## Finding a balance that feels honest

So the question is not whether to expose it to the world. It is how to do that without stripping away the part that makes it meaningful to build.

For now, my balance looks something like this:

Keep coding because I enjoy coding.
Ship small changes regularly.
Let a few real users in.
Listen carefully, but do not chase every reaction.

In other words, protect the joy, but invite reality.

If you are in a similar position, leading teams by day and building for yourself at night, this tension is familiar. The craft pulls you inward. The ambition to make something useful pulls you outward.

Both are valid.

The challenge is making sure that growth does not erase the reason you started building in the first place.

I could just keep building.

But I suspect the next real step is letting someone else step into the loop with me.
