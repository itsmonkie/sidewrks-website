I built the first version of rcordr a couple of years ago.

It wasn't a startup idea, a product bet, or something I intended to show to anyone. It was a builder's move. I wanted a very simple way to track a few measures I cared about, without committing to someone else's structure, language, or assumptions about what a "good" system should look like.

At the time, I wasn't thinking about users or markets. I was thinking about myself, my own tendency to drift, and my need for something lightweight that would help me stay oriented. rcordr was the smallest thing that could do that.

For a long time, that's where it stayed. I used it quietly. I tweaked it occasionally. I didn't really talk about it, and I didn't feel any pressure to make it more than it was.

Over the last year or so, though, something shifted. I've found myself more interested in investing time in it again. Not because it suddenly became impressive, but because it's genuinely helped me. It's gone from being a background tool to something that's earned its place in my day.

## How it helps me day to day

I've always been drawn to tracking measures and habits. Sometimes that's useful, sometimes it's just a personality trait. rcordr is where that tendency has landed in a way that feels constructive.

I use it daily to record whatever feels relevant to my objectives at the time. That might be how many hours I've spent working on side projects, how much protein I've eaten, or a simple judgement about whether the day was high performing or not. Those measures change over time, and I like that they can.

The value isn't really in the specific metrics. It's in the act of deciding what matters right now, then noticing it consistently. rcordr helps me keep my attention on what I believe contributes to progress, rather than what happens to feel urgent or visible.

There's also something important about the simplicity. It lives in my pocket. It does one job. I don't have to configure a dashboard or interpret a report. I open it, record the thing, and move on. That lack of ceremony is probably why it's stuck around.

Over time, it's helped me stay more honest with myself about where my effort is actually going. When I look back over a week or a month, it's harder to tell myself stories that aren't backed by something concrete. That honesty isn't always comfortable, but it's usually useful.

## What still feels awkward or missing

Despite that, there are plenty of rough edges.

The data mostly lives on the device, which makes it feel more fragile than it should. I'd like it backed up, and probably accessible on the web. Not because I want to analyse it constantly, but because I want to trust that it's safe.

Visualisation is another obvious gap. Recording data is easy, but it's harder than I'd like to quickly see trends, consistency, or drift over time. Even simple graphs would help turn a list of entries into something more reflective.

There's also a conceptual flatness to it at the moment. Some things I track are outcomes. Some are lead indicators. Others are just habits I want to reinforce. rcordr treats them all the same, and that makes it harder to reason about what's actually driving what.

I find myself wanting a bit more help interpreting the data, not just collecting it. That's where the idea of pairing it with a well informed AI coach starts to creep in. Something that could reflect patterns back to me, ask better questions, or pull in context from places like Apple Health. It's an appealing direction, but also one that's easy to get wrong.

## What I don't know yet

The biggest uncertainty is whether rcordr goes beyond being a personal system.

I don't know if it becomes a commercial product. I don't know if other people would want something this flexible, or whether they'd get the same value from it that I do. It might only work because it's tightly aligned to how I think.

Right now, I'm deliberately not forcing an answer. I'm resisting the urge to position it, package it, or justify its existence. I'm more interested in continuing to use it, improve it, and pay attention to what it gives me over time.

At the moment, rcordr is a thing I built that helps me focus on what matters. Whether it becomes anything more than that is still an open question, and I'm comfortable leaving it unresolved.
