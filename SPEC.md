# Sidewrks — SPEC

## Purpose

Sidewrks is a quiet workspace for shipping side projects in public.  
It exists to make decisions, progress, and outcomes visible over time.

This is not a community, a personal brand site, or a content platform.

---

## Primary Goals

- Ship small, real artefacts
- Make decisions explicit
- Create exposure to real signal
- Build momentum through doing

---

## Non-Goals

Sidewrks will not:

- Optimise for audience growth
- Host discussions or comments
- Act as a social network
- Encourage speculation over execution
- Accumulate half-finished ideas

If something does not directly support shipping or learning, it is out of scope.

---

## Information Architecture

### Pages

- `/`  
  Overview of what Sidewrks is and what is currently being built

- `/projects`  
  List of all projects with clear status:
  `idea | building | live | paused | killed`

- `/projects/[slug]`  
  Project detail pages containing:

  - What it is
  - Why it exists
  - Current scope
  - Status
  - Links to artefacts or logs

- `/about`  
  Short context on the author and the intent of Sidewrks

## Content Rules

### Projects

- Every project must have a status
- Status changes must be reflected explicitly
- Killing a project is a valid outcome

---

## Design Rules

- Content first, design second
- Single column layout
- Minimal colour, near-monochrome
- No illustrations or stock imagery
- Typography over components
- No animations by default

If design draws attention to itself, it has failed.

---

## Interaction Rules

- No comments
- No likes
- No follower mechanics
- No gamification

Signal comes from reality, not engagement metrics.

---

## Cadence

- At least one visible update per week:
  - A shipped artefact
  - A decision
  - A status change

Silence is acceptable only if nothing meaningful happened.

---

## Expansion Criteria

New features are added only when forced by signal.

Examples:

- Email updates only if people ask
- Community only if active contributors exist
- Monetisation only after clear utility

Default answer to new ideas: **no**.

---

## Decision Authority

This spec overrides templates, defaults, and frameworks.

If Cursor or a library suggests something that conflicts with this document, the spec wins.
